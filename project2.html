                <h3>Waterloo Engineering Competition, consulting</h3>
             <h1>Problem Space</h1>
            <h2>
                <u>"</u>The government has decided to hire your consulting team to help them create a 5-year strategy to increase the number of plug-in vehicles in Ontario.  They have budgeted 5 to 7 million dollars for this project and want your team to decide on the key initiatives and programs they should implement over 5 years.<u>"</u>
                
                </h2>
                
                <h1>Solution</h1>
            <h2>
                Ultimately the goal is to first educate consumers on the benefits of using electric vehicles and the new policies that will be implemented, and then subsidize EV usersâ€™ electricity costs for a 5 year transition period. By the end of five years, the funding to companies should accelerate innovations, making electric vehicles cheaper and more efficient than conventional vehicles and as a result, increase their popularity.
                </h2>
                
                <h1>ElectroGO APP</h1>
                <h2>We designed a mobile application to help new electric vehicle users with issues such as remotely
                monitoring battery levels, charging notifications and reminders, and finding an easy way to quickly locate nearby charging stations.</h2>
            <h2>This user friendly, free app will help smooth the transition from conventional vehicle
            to electric transportation, as well as fitting into the busy, tech-driven life of the average Ontarian. </h2>
